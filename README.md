# Exp 04- HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Hospital Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):

## Step 1: Problem Identification

Manual hospital record handling causes delays and errors in patient care. The system aims to automate patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and report management.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, and Patient.  
Main Functions: Patient registration, appointment booking, doctor management, billing, medical report handling, and discharge summary.    
Non-Functional Needs: Security of patient data, reliability, and easy access.    

## Step 3: System Design

Create UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.    
Design database tables for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Bills, and Reports.
